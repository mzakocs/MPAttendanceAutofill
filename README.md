## Files

* popup.js
    * The main file for the extension. Injects a script into an attendance form to auto-fill it, keeps track of when they've been completed, and allows you to easily open class meetings.
* options.js
    * This is where the user configures the extension. Allows them to input all of their class attendance links, meeting links, and their student information.

## Release History

* 2.0
    * Added the ability to easily open meeting links in the extension popup.
    * Added the Google Meet Code Utility (GMCU), an easy way to join meetings from teachers that don't have a permanent conference link
    * Added the ability to create aliases for different classes. For example, you can now have a class labeled as "World History" instead of just "Period 1."
    * Added a preferences section. Includes options such as opening attendance links in new tabs and not automatically submitting forms (for the paranoid; allows you to check the info before manually submitting).
    * Added an experimental "Fill Out All Forms" feature. When enabled in settings, adds a button to the bottom of the popup that will quickly fill out all of your forms for the day. This is basically a "Wednesday Mode."
    * Completely recoded script injection system for auto-filling scripts. Now uses a background script that is much more robust and reliable. Also brings the benefit of allowing auto-completion of all of the attendance forms at once.
    * Added clearer instructions for the basic operation off the extension after criticism of the initial documentation.
    * Heavily improved the layout & styling of the popup and options menus.
    * Added a light theme to the options menu that is triggered by CSS media queries.
    * Improved the comments on many different parts of the source code.
    * Fixed a bug where the red X next to a recently auto-filled form wouldn't change to a green checkmark until the extension menu was closed and re-opened.
    * Fixed a bug where the 10th period attendance link wasn't being saved or displayed properly.
    * Fixed a bug where the form auto-fill would suddenly stop if the popup menu was closed before script injection began.

* 1.1
   * Fixed some small bugs/issues that were reported from the first release.
   * Created a longer time buffer between the data input and the data submission on the form auto-fill script.

* 1.0
    * First Release
